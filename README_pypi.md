**BareBonesNN** is a lightweight neural network library implemented from scratch in Python, without relying on high-level machine learning libraries. This project aims to provide a clear and fundamental understanding of neural network concepts and operations, making it an excellent educational resource for learning and experimentation.

## Features

- **Basic Neural Network Components**: Core classes including `Value`, `Neuron`, `Layer`, and `MLP` (Multi-Layer Perceptron).
- **Automatic Differentiation**: Built-in backpropagation for gradient computation.
- **Customisable and Extensible**: Easily modify and extend the code to experiment with various neural network architectures.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, focusing on core principles.

## Installation

To install BareBonesNN, use pip:

```bash
pip install barebonesnn==0.1.0
```
